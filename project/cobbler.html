            <aside class="main"> <p>Practicing portion control and mindful baking lets you enjoy desserts without hurting your health. Focus on small, clearly measured servings—like mini desserts or pre-cut portions—served on smaller plates to make them feel satisfying while keeping calories in check. Eat slowly, savor each bite, and use slightly healthier ingredients or reduced sugar so your treats fit more comfortably into an overall balanced diet.</p> </aside>
            <h2>History of Cobbler</h2>
                <p>Cobbler is a traditional baked dessert that originated in the early American colonies, where British settlers improvised fruit puddings using the ingredients and equipment they had on hand. Instead of steamed suet puddings, they covered seasonal fruit with simple spoonfuls of biscuit or batter dough and baked it in cast-iron pots.</p>
                <p> This rustic creation became popular across the United States, especially in the South, where it evolved into iconic dishes like peach cobbler. Over time, cobbler developed many regional variations, but it has remained a beloved, homey dessert known for its simplicity and adaptability.</p>
