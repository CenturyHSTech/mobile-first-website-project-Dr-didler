        <p>1 cup cake flour
        1 ½ cups white sugar, divided

                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to degrees F (190 degrees C). Clean and fully dry a> 10-inch tube pan. Sift together flour, and 3/4 cup sugar, set aside. Whip egg whites, along with vanilla, cream of tartar, and salt, in a large bowl to medium stiff peaks. Gradually add remaining 3/4 cup sugar while continuing to whip to stiff peaks. When the egg white mixture has reached its maximum volume, fold in the sifted ingredients gradually, 1/3 at a time. Do not overmix. Put the batter into the tube pan.</li>
                        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cake springs back when touched, 40 to 45 minutes. Balance the tube pan upside down on the top of a bottle to prevent decompression while cooling. When cool, run a knife around the edge of the pan and invert onto a plate.</li>
                    </ol>

Focus on small, clearly measured servings—like mini desserts or pre-cut portions—served on smaller plates to make them feel satisfying while keeping calories in check. Eat slowly, savor each bite, and use slightly healthier ingredients or reduced sugar so your treats fit more comfortably into an overall balanced diet.</p> </aside>

            <h2>History of Angel Food Cake</h2>
                <p>Angel food cake emerged in the United States during the mid-1800s, a time when improved kitchen tools made it easier to whip large quantities of egg whites by hand. Its unique texture quickly set it apart from heavier, butter-based cakes.</p>
                <p>The cakes signature lightness comes from its ingredients: whipped egg whites, sugar, and a small amount of flour. Because it contains no fat, bakers often described it as so airy and delicate that it seemed “fit for angels,” which helped inspire its name.</p>
                <p>By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, angel food cake became a staple at celebrations and summer gatherings across America. It remains a beloved classic today, valued for its simple ingredients, cloud-like crumb, and timeless charm.</p>
